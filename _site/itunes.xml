Recently I was fortunate enough to speak to Scott Drucker, the head legal advisor for the Arizona Association of Realtors, regarding an important topic: the 8 things to keep in mind when handling Buyer’s Inspection Notice Seller Response (BINSR) forms

Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure: 

00:19 - An introduction to today’s guest: Scott Drucker

01:09 - Why I chose to speak to Scott regarding this topic

02:34 - Point No. 1: Set realistic expectations

04:37 - Point No. 2: Only submit a BINSR form once

05:24 - Point No. 3: Use additional space (if necessary) 

07:17 - Point No. 4: Be ultra-specific

09:30 - Point No. 5: Don’t ask the seller for additional inspections

11:00 - Point No. 6: Get timeline extensions in writing

12:36 - Point No. 7: Include a reason for cancellation if “Premises Rejected” is selected

15:00 - Point No. 8: Realize that BINSRs are not designed to alter contracts

17:05 - A quick conclusion to today’s topic
