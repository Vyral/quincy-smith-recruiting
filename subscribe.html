<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in {{site.data.settings.client.market}}?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 3500+ homes sold in the greater Yuma market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell over 1,400 homes last year and our average full-time agent earns over $100,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</oL></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"The training I receive at ERA Matt Fischer Realtor is absolutely wonderful.  My broker is completely committed to supporting my growth instead of competing against me.  All of the necessary systems, training and leads are provided to me to insure my success." </span><br>
<span class="author">- Starr Schulte</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"My broker (Quincy Smith) is 100% committed to my success.  He meets with me one-on-one and in group training several times every week.  We are also offered profession coaching through the Mike Ferry organization at no additional cost.  ERA is the company of choice if you want to become a high producing agent."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Chuy Ibarra</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"What I like most about ERA Matt Fischer Realtor is the environment and accountability I receive and need.  The training/coaching is awesome, but what I really like is the culture of excellence at ERA.  It is so much easier to do what I have to do to succeed when I am held accountable and surrounded by other highly successful agents."</span><br>
