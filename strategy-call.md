<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Quincy Smith and we’ve sold thousands of homes.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"The training I receive at ERA Matt Fischer Realtor is absolutely wonderful.  My broker is completely committed to supporting my growth instead of competing against me.  All of the necessary systems, training and leads are provided to me to insure my success." </span><br>
<span class="author">- Starr Schulte</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"My broker (Quincy Smith) is 100% committed to my success.  He meets with me one-on-one and in group training several times every week.  We are also offered profession coaching through the Mike Ferry organization at no additional cost.  ERA is the company of choice if you want to become a high producing agent."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Chuy Ibarra</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"What I like most about ERA Matt Fischer Realtor is the environment and accountability I receive and need.  The training/coaching is awesome, but what I really like is the culture of excellence at ERA.  It is so much easier to do what I have to do to succeed when I am held accountable and surrounded by other highly successful agents."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
